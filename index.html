  <!-- Once the image is available on our local disk,
  we can use its location as the value of the src attribute.
  Because the image is part of the same web project as index.html,
  we can use the RELATIVE path to the image, like this: -->

        <img src="images/kitten.jpg" alt="An adorable kitten">

  <!--The src attribute images/kitten.jpg will automatically be interpreted
  as the correct full path to the file, which locally might be:
  file:///Users/mhartl/repos/sample_website/images/kitten.jpg

    When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials. You
    should follow Lee on Twitter

    You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen
    table. You should follow Nick on Twitter
